This repository is a repro of a bug mini-css-extract-plugin@1.3.0 introduces when using external-svg-sprite-plugin@6.0.1.

In 1.2.0 folder, mini-css-extract-plugin@1.2.0 is installed and the webpack build succeeds.

In 1.3.0 folder, mini-css-extract-plugin@1.3.0 is installed and the webpack build fails.
